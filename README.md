# md_calendar

A sample mod_dart application.

MD Calendar uses the sqljocky, mustache, and path Dart packages just to demonstrate this can be done
with mod_dart. Its not complete and a bit buggy but its not intended to be useful, only as a demonstrator.

This was recoded from the lwc PHP package and retains much of its original PHP structure.
